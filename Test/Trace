***** Computation of Pi with John Machin's formula *****

** i.e.: pi=16*arctan(1/5)-4*arctan(1/239)

How many digits of pi do you want ? 

I am now computing the following sum: arctan(1/5)=1/5 -1/3*1/5^3 +1/5*1/5^5
-1/7*1/5^7 +1/9*1/5^9 -1/11*1/5^11 +1/13*1/5^13 -1/15*1/5^15 +1/17*1/5^17
-1/19*1/5^19 +1/21*1/5^21 -1/23*1/5^23 +1/25*1/5^25 -1/27*1/5^27 +1/29*1/5^29
-1/31*1/5^31 +1/33*1/5^33 -1/35*1/5^35 +1/37*1/5^37 -1/39*1/5^39 +1/41*1/5^41
-1/43*1/5^43 +1/45*1/5^45 -1/47*1/5^47 +1/49*1/5^49 -1/51*1/5^51 +1/53*1/5^53
-1/55*1/5^55 +1/57*1/5^57 -1/59*1/5^59 +1/61*1/5^61 -1/63*1/5^63 +1/65*1/5^65
-1/67*1/5^67 +1/69*1/5^69 -1/71*1/5^71 +1/73*1/5^73 -1/75*1/5^75 +1/77*1/5^77
-1/79*1/5^79 +1/81*1/5^81 -1/83*1/5^83 +1/85*1/5^85 -1/87*1/5^87 +1/89*1/5^89
-1/91*1/5^91 +1/93*1/5^93 -1/95*1/5^95 +1/97*1/5^97 -1/99*1/5^99
+1/101*1/5^101 -1/103*1/5^103 +1/105*1/5^105 -1/107*1/5^107 +1/109*1/5^109
-1/111*1/5^111 +1/113*1/5^113 -1/115*1/5^115 +1/117*1/5^117 -1/119*1/5^119
+1/121*1/5^121 -1/123*1/5^123 +1/125*1/5^125 -1/127*1/5^127 +1/129*1/5^129
-1/131*1/5^131 +1/133*1/5^133 -1/135*1/5^135 +1/137*1/5^137 -1/139*1/5^139
+1/141*1/5^141 -1/143*1/5^143 +1/145*1/5^145 
Now, I multiply it by 16... done

I am now computing the following sum: arctan(1/239)=1/239 -1/3*1/239^3
+1/5*1/239^5 -1/7*1/239^7 +1/9*1/239^9 -1/11*1/239^11 +1/13*1/239^13
-1/15*1/239^15 +1/17*1/239^17 -1/19*1/239^19 +1/21*1/239^21 -1/23*1/239^23
+1/25*1/239^25 -1/27*1/239^27 +1/29*1/239^29 -1/31*1/239^31 +1/33*1/239^33
-1/35*1/239^35 +1/37*1/239^37 -1/39*1/239^39 +1/41*1/239^41 -1/43*1/239^43
+1/45*1/239^45 
Now, I multiply it by 4... done

And finally, I subtract 4*arctan(1/239) to 16*arctan(1/5) which results in :
