Compiling instructions.

Only standard C++ libraries are required. Just say make,
this will provide a tralics binary.
You can uncomment the line 'CPPFLAGS=-g -Wall' in case of trouble.
This Software was compiled on Windows (cygwin gcc 3.4.4)
on linux/fedora (gcc 3.4.4), on MacOS 10.4 (gcc 4.0.0)

The binary contains the default location of the tralics configuration files.
You can modify this in the following way:
a) uncomment the line RAOPT=somevalue
  and set the variable TRALICSDIR (it can be an argument of make)
b) edit the file txpath.h and define TRALICSDIR there.
