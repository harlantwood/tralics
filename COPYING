Tralics is a software that comes with 1) the sources files, 
2) some test files, 3) some utilitary files, 4) the documentation.

The distribution includes 1, 2 and 3. Some utilitary files are
copies, or modifications of files found on the WEB, with their own
copyright notice (see the README file for the list of these files).

The source files are Copyright by Inria, see notice below.

The test files are some TeX files that can be translated by tralics.
You can use or modify them as you wish. 
If you distribute a modified version of Tralics, make sure that
the script alltests runs.


If you modify the raweb configuration file, confdir/ra.tcf,
or a file of the form ra2007.tcf, 
you should modify or remove the line containing `tralics ident',
as explained in the file.
